            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ihsan, a 15-year-old who is passionate about computer science and programming.
                I love learning and exploring new things, especially in the fields of science and technology.
            </p>
            
            <p>  
                I enjoy creating interesting and fun projects, and I'm always looking for new ideas to work on.
                I like to work with Rust, NodeJS, and TypeScript, with frameworks like Svelte and Express. I like to
                experiment with new technologies and tools, and I'm always looking to learn new things.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Outside of programming, I like listening to music and podcasts, play games and watch movies.
            </p>
